# PgBouncerHero-Demo

This is the demo app running on https://pgbouncerhero-demo.herokuapp.com (Heroku killed it by removing the free plan sorry!) demonstrating the usage of [pgbouncerhero](https://github.com/kwent/pgbouncerhero).

## Installation

### One PgBouncer

```bash
export PGBOUNCERHERO_DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:port/pgbouncer
```

### Multiple PgBouncers

Create `config/pgbouncerhero.yml` with:

```yml
default: &default
  pgbouncers:
    production:
      master:
        url: <%= ENV["PGBOUNCER_MASTER_DATABASE_URL"] %>
      slave:
        url: <%= ENV["PGBOUNCER_SLAVE_DATABASE_URL"] %>

development:
  <<: *default

production:
  <<: *default
```

## Heroku

This demo app is using following buildpacks:

```bash
# You need to fork your own to set the allow your database username to access pgbouncer database.
heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/kwent/heroku-buildpack-pgbouncer
# Regular ruby buildpack
heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-ruby
```

and config:

```bash
heroku config:set PGBOUNCER_PREPARED_STATEMENTS=false
heroku config:set PGBOUNCERHERO_DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@127.0.0.1:6000/pgbouncer
```
